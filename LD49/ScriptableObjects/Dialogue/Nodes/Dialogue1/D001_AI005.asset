  dialogueLine: A long time ago in a Timeline far, far away, I participated in a
    GameJam called "Ludum Dare". As so often before, after finishing my game, I played
    the Games of the other participants. Then I started "Lost In Time". I have been
    wandering through the minds of historical persons, since that moment. Didn`t
    the same happen to you?
